## Limitation/Assumptions made of data available:
No information on where casual riders lives in the Cyclistic service area due to data-privacy issues prohibit the use of riders’ personally identifiable information.

Analysis and insights will be limited on the casual rider’s behaviour as there are no data on types of purchase (single pass or full-day pass) and if there are multiple purchases from the same casual rider.
